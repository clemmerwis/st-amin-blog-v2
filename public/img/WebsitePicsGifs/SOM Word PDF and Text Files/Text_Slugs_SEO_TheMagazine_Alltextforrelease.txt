Body: Health and healing have always been close to my heart. With 16 years in pharmacy, having gone through the pharmacy technician program, and certifications in fitness and nutrition, I've dedicated my life to understanding the intricate balance of body, mind, and spirit.

Growing up, I was always sensitive to the energies around me, often feeling the emotional currents of people and places deeply.

My formal journey began with an in-depth study of Reiki, an ancient Japanese technique for stress reduction and relaxation that also promotes healing. I became a certified Reiki practitioner, learning to channel universal energy to support physical and emotional healing.
